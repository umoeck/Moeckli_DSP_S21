    "#### Brief description of the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is called 'World happiness report', it contains happiness scores and ranking from about 150 contries. Furthermore it contains variables that estimate the contribution of different factors to happiness (economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity). The original data is which was used for the dataset is from Gallup World Poll. In the dataset the countries are compared to a hypothetical country, which represents the world's lowest national averages for each of the variables. The first dataset I found, contains data from 2015 - 2019, later on I found the same data for 2020 and 2021. \n",
    "I chose this dataset because I could get a good overview on the data, but still I think it is complex enough for the final project. Further on, I think i'm interessted in the content and the related output."

    "\n",
    "> There are between 9 and 20 variables. All the data sets contain: Country name, Region, Happiness Rank, Happiness Score, GDP per Capita, Family/ Social Support, Health/ Life Expectancy, Freedom, Trust in Government/ Perception of corruption, Generosity. Some of the datasets contain also additional varibales (standard error, whiskers).\n",
